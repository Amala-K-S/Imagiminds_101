**To get started :-**
  1. Clone this project 
  2. run npm install from root folder
  3. Paste the default.json file into the config folder. ( will be shared personally for security reasons )
  4. Add routes to routers/api 
  5. There is a designated folder for each type of route eg, for users, for courses etc
  6. Please make sure to add the new route created, into the readme file as well.

    

    Happy coding :)
